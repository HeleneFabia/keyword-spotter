# Zindi Data Science Challenge: Agricultural Keyword Spotter

This project is part of the [GIZ NLP Agricultural Keyword Spotter](https://zindi.africa/competitions/giz-nlp-agricultural-keyword-spotter) challenge by Zindi. 

The goal of this challenge is to classify keywords in Luganda and English in audioclips. These keywords relate to crops, diseases, fertilizers, and other agricultural topics. The keyword classifier is then used by Makerere University to  build a speech recognition model in order to automatically monitor radio prgrams in Uganda for agriculture-related information. Since in Uganda, radio programmes are essential to deliver information to rural communities, these programmes can bring valuable insights into the Ugandan agriculture sector to researchers, governments and other decision makers.

#### The dataset

The data consists of around 4000 audio files, each containing one of 193 spoken keywords in English or Luganda. What poses a challenge here is that for some keywords there are only a handful of audio files in the training set.

In order to gain a better grasp of the data, I visualized the audio files as spectrograms. Below, the spectrograms for three different audio files containing the keyword "banana" can be seen.
